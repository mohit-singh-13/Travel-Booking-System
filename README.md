# üß≥ **Travel Booking System**

A simple and functional travel agency application built with the MERN stack and Nextjs. This application allows users to browse tour packages, book a package, generate invoices, and provides an admin panel for managing packages and bookings.

**IMPORTANT NOTE :** The backend is hosted on a free instance of Render, which spins down after 15 minutes of
inactivity. This may cause a 40-50 seconds delay when restarting the server, so please expect some delay for first request when visiting website
for the first time after a period of inactivity.
